# These are project-level dependencies.  For any module-specific ones, add it
# to a `requirements.txt` file in that module and then put an entry to that
# *file* here.  It's fine if indiviual modules' requirements overlap, so
# make sure any dependency that would be needed for it to run independently
# of the rest of the system is included.
# Example: `-r semanticsimilarity/requirements.txt`
